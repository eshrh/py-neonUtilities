# Py-NEONutilities

This project is a heavy work in progress to write a native python wrapper for the [NEON data platform](https://data.neonscience.org).
It aims to provide the functionality of the [NEONutilities R package](https://github.com/NEONScience/NEON-utilities/tree/master/neonUtilities)
without the overhead of having to manage `rpy`.

## Progress
- [X] Observational data
  - [X] Download data zips 
  - [X] Table stacking
  - [ ] Support for READMEs, EML and variables files
- [ ] AOP/EC data
- [ ] package for pypi

You can install this package from pypi with `pip install py-neonUtils`
